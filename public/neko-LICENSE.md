## Original Neko95/98 Source Code License

The JavaScript implementation in this repository is based on the Neko95/98 Windows port by David Harvey (1998), which was itself a port of the original X-Windows Neko by Masayuki Koba.

**Note:** Because Neko was originally written by Masayuki Koba, and ported from his X-Windows source code by David Harvey, different portions of the original Neko source code carry different licenses.

## License Compliance

This JavaScript implementation (`neko.js`) is a reimplementation of the core Neko behavior (corresponding to `Neko.h` and `Neko.cpp` from the original source), which is covered by the GNU General Public License. Therefore, this JavaScript version is also released under **GNU GPL v3**.

This implementation does NOT use or reimpl the Pet class hierarchy (`Pet.h/cpp`, `DesktopPet.h/cpp`, `AlwaysOnTopPet.h/cpp`), which carried commercial licensing restrictions in the original. Instead, it provides a simplified web-based rendering system using standard DOM APIs.

As this is a **non-commercial, free software** implementation released under GPL, it complies with all requirements of the original license:
1. ✅ Credit is given to the original authors
2. ✅ Source code is freely available
3. ✅ No commercial licensing fees apply (free software)
4. ✅ GPL terms are preserved for derivative works
